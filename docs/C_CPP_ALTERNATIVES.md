# C/C++ Alternatives to JavaCard for SIM Development

## Overview

While JavaCard dominates the SIM card development landscape, there are several alternatives that allow C/C++ development. Here are your options:

## 1. MULTOS (Multi-application Operating System)

**Best option for C developers!**

MULTOS is a secure smart card operating system that supports development in:
- **C Language** (primary language)
- **MEL** (MULTOS Executable Language - assembly-like)
- **Basic** (for simpler applications)

### MULTOS Advantages:
- Direct C development without Java
- More flexible memory management
- Better performance for compute-intensive tasks
- Used in high-security applications (banking, government)
- Supports multiple applications on one card

### MULTOS Development:
```c
// Example MULTOS C application
#include <multos.h>

void main(void) {
    BYTE command[5];
    BYTE response[256];
    
    // Get APDU command
    GetAPDU(command, response);
    
    // Process command
    switch(command[1]) {
        case 0x20: // Verify PIN
            verifyPIN(command, response);
            break;
        // ... more cases
    }
    
    // Send response
    SendAPDU(response);
}
```

### MULTOS Tools:
- **SmartDeck** - Development environment
- **MUtil** - Application loader
- **C Compiler** - Based on standard C

## 2. BasicCard

**Good for prototyping and learning**

BasicCard by ZeitControl supports:
- **ZC-Basic** (BASIC-like language)
- **Inline assembly** for performance-critical code
- Professional versions support **C-like syntax**

### BasicCard Features:
- Easier learning curve than JavaCard
- Built-in file system
- Good documentation
- Real hardware available for testing

### BasicCard Example:
```basic
' BasicCard example
Declare Command &H20 VerifyPIN(PIN as String*8)
Declare Command &H30 RunDoom()

Sub RunDoom()
    ' Your Doom logic here
    Call DrawFrame()
    Call ProcessInput()
End Sub
```

## 3. Native ARM Development (Modern SIM Cards)

Some modern SIM cards use ARM processors and can be programmed directly:

### Native Development Options:
- **ARM Assembly** - Direct hardware control
- **C with custom runtime** - No OS overhead
- **Bare metal C++** - With careful memory management

### Challenges:
- Requires deep knowledge of the specific chip
- No standard SDK
- Security features may block custom code
- Vendor-specific tools needed

## 4. Software SIM Solutions

For development and testing, consider software-based SIMs:

### swSIM (C Implementation)
```c
// Software SIM in C
#include "swsim.h"

int main() {
    swsim_init();
    
    // Implement SIM card behavior
    while(1) {
        apdu_command cmd = swsim_get_command();
        apdu_response resp = process_command(cmd);
        swsim_send_response(resp);
    }
}
```

### Benefits:
- Full C/C++ development
- Easy debugging
- No hardware limitations
- Good for proof of concept

## 5. Hybrid Approaches

### JNI Bridge (JavaCard + C)
- Write performance-critical code in C
- Use JavaCard for card interface
- Limited by JavaCard security model

### Custom Bootloader
- Write minimal JavaCard applet
- Load and execute native code
- Very complex, may violate security

## Recommendations for Doom8088 on SIM

Given your requirements, here's my recommendation:

### 1. **Start with Software SIM (swSIM)**
- Develop and test in pure C
- No Java required
- Understand memory constraints
- Profile performance

### 2. **Move to MULTOS for Hardware**
- Best C support on real cards
- More memory flexibility
- Better performance than JavaCard
- Real hardware available

### 3. **Consider BasicCard for Prototyping**
- Easier than MULTOS
- Good for learning
- Can mix BASIC and assembly

### 4. **Last Resort: Minimal JavaCard**
- Only if no other option works
- Use as thin wrapper only
- Call native methods if possible

## Getting MULTOS Development Kit

```bash
# MULTOS is commercial but has evaluation versions
# Contact MULTOS International for SDK

# For learning/testing, try software SIM first:
cd /mnt/c/Users/willi/esim-dooom
git clone https://github.com/tomasz-lisowski/swsim
cd swsim
make

# This gives you a C-based SIM environment to start with
```

## Memory Comparison

| Platform   | Language | Typical RAM | Code Space | Best For |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| JavaCard   | Java     | 2-8 KB      | 32-64 KB   | Standard apps |
| MULTOS     | C        | 4-16 KB     | 64-256 KB  | Complex apps |
| BasicCard  | BASIC/C  | 8-16 KB     | 128-256 KB | Prototyping |
| Native ARM | C/ASM    | Varies      | Varies     | Full control |

## Next Steps

1. Clone swSIM for immediate C development
2. Contact MULTOS International for evaluation kit
3. Design Doom8088 with 4-8 KB RAM constraint
4. Create minimal rendering engine
5. Test on software SIM first

The good news is you can absolutely avoid Java and work in C/C++!
