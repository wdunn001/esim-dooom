# Quick Answer: Can We Use RAD-Doom?

## Short Answer: Not Directly, BUT...

**RAD-Doom** = Raspberry Pi doing all the work + C64 as display
**Not** = Doom running on C64 

### BUT we can steal these techniques:

1. **Dithering for Text Mode** ✓
   ```
   RAD: Colors → Our: ASCII brightness
   ▒▒▒▒ → ::::  (medium brightness)
   ████ → ####  (full brightness)
   ```

2. **Block Constraints** ✓
   ```
   RAD: 4 colors/block → Our: Consistent ASCII/block
   Makes text more readable
   ```

3. **Frame Tricks** ✓
   ```
   RAD: 50Hz flicker → Our: Could alternate patterns
   Example: / and \ alternating = X effect
   ```

4. **Smart Reduction** ✓
   ```
   RAD: 320x200 → 160x200
   Our: Complex → Simple ASCII
   ```

## What This Means:

```
Original Doom:     4MB    (4,096 KB)
     ↓
Doom8088:         1.5MB   (1,536 KB)  
     ↓
RAD-Doom:      Uses 1GB RPi (cheating!)
     ↓
eSIM Doom:        8KB    (Our target)
```

## I've Already Implemented It!

Check out `src/doom/rad_inspired.c`:
- ASCII dithering (like RAD's color dithering)
- Block coherence (like RAD's 4x8 blocks)
- Temporal effects (like RAD's flicker fusion)

## The Reality:

Even with a Raspberry Pi, RAD-Doom shows how hard it is to run Doom on retro hardware. But their **rendering techniques** are perfect for us to adapt!

### Try our demos to see:
```bash
# Basic ASCII 3D
./build/visual_doom8088

# Could add RAD-inspired dithering next!
```

**Bottom line**: RAD-Doom's clever display tricks work great for SIM cards, just at a MUCH simpler scale!
