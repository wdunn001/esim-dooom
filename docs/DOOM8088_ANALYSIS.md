# Doom8088 - Correct Analysis

## You're Right! Doom8088 Memory Requirements:

- **EMS**: 64 KB (if available)
- **XMS**: 1507 KB (1.5 MB) as RAM drive
- **Total**: ~1.5 MB (not 4MB!)

## This Changes Things!

### Doom8088 Already Has:
1. **Text mode support!** (80x25, 40x25, etc.)
2. **Ultra-low memory optimizations**
3. **16-bit processor support**
4. **CGA/EGA/VGA modes**

### Memory Comparison (Corrected):
```
Original Doom:  4,096 KB (4 MB)
     ↓
Doom8088:      1,571 KB (1.5 MB) - Already 2.6x smaller!
     ↓
SIM Card:          8 KB         - Still 196x smaller needed
```

## Can We Use Doom8088 Directly?

### The Good News:
- It already runs in text mode!
- It's already optimized for 16-bit
- It's already stripped down
- Source code is available

### The Challenge:
- Still needs 196x more memory than SIM cards have
- Assumes DOS environment
- Needs XMS/EMS memory managers

## New Strategy: Learn from Doom8088

### What We Can Borrow:
1. **Text mode rendering** - They already solved this!
2. **Fixed-point math** - No floating point
3. **Simplified game logic** - Already stripped down
4. **Memory techniques** - How they fit it in 1.5MB

### Let's Look at Their Text Mode:

Doom8088 uses text mode with:
- Character 0xB1 (▒) for dithering/shading
- Direct video memory writes
- Multiple resolutions (80x25, 40x25, 80x50, etc.)
- Color attributes for "fake" graphics

### Key Findings from i_vtext.c:
```c
#define DITHER_CHARACTER 0xb1  // ▒ character
#define PLANEWIDTH (VIEWWINDOWWIDTH*2)  // 2 bytes per char (char + attribute)
```

### How Doom8088 Does Text Mode:
1. Uses the ▒ character with different colors
2. Each "pixel" is a text character
3. Colors simulate different brightness levels
4. Still needs 1.5MB for game logic/data

### What We Can Learn:

1. **Text Mode Technique**: Use special characters for shading
2. **Memory Layout**: Even with text mode, they need 1.5MB
3. **Color Usage**: Different colors simulate brightness
4. **Resolution**: Lower resolution = bigger "pixels"

## The Reality Check

Even with all optimizations, Doom8088 still needs:
- 1.5MB total memory (196x more than SIM cards have)
- DOS environment
- x86 processor architecture

## Our Approach for eSIM Doom

### What We CAN Use from Doom8088:
- Text mode rendering concept ✓
- Dithering with special characters ✓
- Fixed-point math ✓
- Simplified game mechanics ✓

### What We CAN'T Use:
- The actual code (too big)
- WAD file loading (no space)
- Most game assets (textures, sprites)
- Complex map formats

### Our Solution:
1. Take the CONCEPTS from Doom8088
2. Rebuild from scratch for 8KB
3. Use similar text mode techniques
4. But MUCH simpler implementation

## Try Our Demo:
```bash
make visual && ./build/visual_test
```

This shows our ultra-minimal approach that actually fits in 8KB!
