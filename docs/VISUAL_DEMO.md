# Getting Visual Output - eSIM Doom

## Current Architecture

```
Your Question: "Do we need to compile Doom8088?"

Answer: Not exactly - we need to PORT it piece by piece.
```

### What We Have Now

1. **Framework** - The SIM card environment (memory limits, APDU interface)
2. **Minimal Demo** - Basic movement and rendering (not real Doom yet)
3. **Text Output** - 40x25 character "screen" (SIM card limitation)

### How to See Visual Output NOW

```bash
# Build the visual test
make visual

# Run it (shows a text-based "game")
./build/visual_test
```

This shows:
- A bordered 40x25 text screen
- '@' symbol as the player
- '#' symbols as walls
- Movement with WASD keys

## The Path to Real Doom

### Option 1: Direct Port (Very Hard)
```
Doom8088 → Strip down → Fit in 8KB → Text rendering
   ↓          ↓            ↓              ↓
Original   Remove 90%   Optimize    ASCII art
```

### Option 2: Reimplementation (Recommended)
```
Study Doom8088 → Extract core concepts → Rebuild for SIM
      ↓                 ↓                    ↓
  Learn how        Just essentials      Ultra-minimal
```

## What Doom8088 Has vs What We Can Use

| Doom8088 Feature | Can We Use It? | Why/Why Not |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| WAD file loading | ❌ No | Too much memory |
| Texture mapping | ❌ No | Requires lots of RAM |
| 3D rendering | ⚠️ Maybe | Super simplified |
| Map data | ✅ Yes | But much smaller |
| Game logic | ✅ Yes | Core concepts only |
| Enemy AI | ⚠️ Maybe | Very basic |
| Sound | ❌ No | No audio on SIM |

## Next Steps to Get "Real" Doom

### 1. Start with Raycasting Demo
Create a simple raycaster that fits in our memory:

```c
// Mini raycaster for SIM card
void cast_ray(int angle) {
    // Cast a single ray
    // Return distance to wall
    // Draw vertical line based on distance
}
```

### 2. Port Map Format
Doom8088 uses complex WAD files. We need:
```c
// Ultra-simple map (32x32 grid, 128 bytes)
uint8_t map[128];  // 1 bit per cell
```

### 3. Add Game Elements
- Player movement ✓ (already have basic version)
- Wall collision
- Simple enemies (just positions, no sprites)
- Basic "shooting" (raycast check)

## Try Our Current Demo First!

```bash
# See what we have working
make visual && ./build/visual_test
```

You'll see:
- A playable (very basic) demo
- Text-based rendering
- Movement mechanics

## Why Not Just Compile Doom8088?

1. **Memory**: Doom8088 needs ~4MB, SIM cards have 8KB (500x less!)
2. **Display**: Doom8088 uses VGA graphics, SIM cards have... nothing
3. **Architecture**: Doom8088 assumes DOS/PC, SIM cards are embedded

## The Reality

We're not "porting" Doom8088 directly. We're creating "Doom-inspired gameplay that fits on a SIM card" using ideas from Doom8088.

Think of it as:
- **Doom** (1993) → **Doom8088** (stripped down) → **eSIM Doom** (extremely minimal)

## Want to See Better Graphics?

The SIM card version will always be text-based. But the HOST program could:
1. Receive the game state from SIM
2. Render it with real graphics
3. Like a "thin client" architecture

Would you like me to:
1. Run the visual demo to show current progress?
2. Start porting specific Doom8088 components?
3. Create a better rendering system on the host side?
